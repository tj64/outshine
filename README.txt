1.3 Credits
~~~~~~~~~~~

  This library is based on, or rather an extension of, Carsten Dominik's
  `outline-magic' ([https://github.com/tj64/outline-magic]) and my own
  `outxxtra' ([https://github.com/tj64/outxxtra]), which is itself a
  modified extension of Per Abrahamsen's `out-xtra.el'
  ([http://tinyurl.com/aql9p97]). Some ideas were taken from Fabrice
  Niessen's '`.emacs'
  ([http://www.mygooglest.com/fni/dot-emacs.html#sec-2]).


1.4 Commentary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.4.1 About outshine
--------------------

  This library merges, modifies and extends two existing
  extension-libraries for `outline' (minor) mode: `outline-magic' and
  `out-xtra'. It offers all the functionality of `outline-magic' (with
  some tiny changes) and parts of the functionality of `out-xtra',
  together with some new features and ideas.

  See `outline-magic.el' ([https://github.com/tj64/outline-magic]) for
  detailed instructions on usage of the additional outline functions
  introduced by `outline-magic'.

  Furthermore, `outshine.el' includes functions and keybindings from
  `outline-mode-easy-bindings' (http://emacswiki.org/emacs/OutlineMinorMode).
  Unfortunately, no author is given for that library, so I cannot credit the
  person who wrote it.

  Outshines main purpose is to make `outline-minor-mode' more similar to
  outline-navigation and structure-editing with (the one-and-only)
  `Org-mode'. Furthermore, as additional but quite useful features,
  correctly structured outshine-buffers enable the use of `outorg.el'
  (subtree editing in temporary Org-mode buffers) and `navi-mode.el'
  (fast navigation and remote-control via modified occur-buffers).


1.4.2 Installation
------------------

  Download `outshine.el' and copy it to a location where Emacs can find
  it, and use this in your '.emacs' to get started:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (require 'outshine)
   (add-hook  'outline-minor-mode-hook 'outshine-hook-function)
  #+end_src

  If you like the functions and keybindings for 'M -<<arrow-key>>' navigation
  and visibility cycling copied from `outline-mode-easy-bindings', you might
  want to put the following code into your Emacs init file to have the same
  functionality/keybindings available in Org-mode too, overriding the less
  frequently used commands for moving and promoting/demoting subtrees:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                ;; Redefine arrow keys, since promoting/demoting and moving
                ;; subtrees up and down are less frequent tasks then
                ;; navigation and visibility cycling
                (when (require 'outshine nil 'NOERROR)
                  (org-defkey org-mode-map
                              (kbd "M-<left>") 'outline-hide-more)
                  (org-defkey org-mode-map
                              (kbd "M-<right>") 'outline-show-more)
                  (org-defkey org-mode-map
                              (kbd "M-<up>") 'outline-previous-visible-heading)
                  (org-defkey org-mode-map
                              (kbd "M-<down>") 'outline-next-visible-heading)))
              'append)
  #+end_src

  Add this to your .emacs if, e.g., you always want outshine for emacs-lisp
  buffers (recommended):

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (add-hook ‘emacs-lisp-mode-hook ‘outline-minor-mode)
  #+end_src

  If you want a different prefix key for outline-minor-mode, insert
  first:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (defvar outline-minor-mode-prefix "\C-c")
  #+end_src

  or whatever. The prefix can only be changed before outline (minor)
  mode is loaded.


1.4.3 Emacs Version
-------------------

  `outshine.el' works with [GNU Emacs 24.2.1 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,
  GTK+ Version 3.6.4) of 2013-01-20 on eric]. No attempts of testing
  with older versions or other types of Emacs have been made (yet).
